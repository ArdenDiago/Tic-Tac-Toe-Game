# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Objective

This project is a two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game where players can compete against each other on a classic 3x3 grid. The game is built using React and Vite, designed to be simple, interactive, and customizable.

## Game Description

Tic-Tac-Toe is a timeless two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Each player takes turns placing their respective symbols ("X" for Player 1 and "O" for Player 2) on the grid. The objective is to be the first to align three of your symbols in a rowâ€”vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. If all the squares are filled and no player has aligned three symbols, the game ends in a draw.
